# Learn and Understand C++

This is a personal repository to take notes and codes samples for this online course.

# Some Notes

- Chapters 1 and 2 were basically introduction and IDE setup, so we don't have codes for them;
- In course, the instructor used [Codeblocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) but I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) installed;
- All examples here were compiled with [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) in Linux (Linux Mint);
