# Learn and Understand C++
This is a personal repository to take notes and codes samples for this online course.

# Some Notes
* Chapters 1 and 2 are basically introduction and IDE setup;
* In course, the instructor used Codeblocks but I used Visual Studio Code with C++ Extension installed;
* All examples here were compiled with g++ in Linux (Linux Mint);
